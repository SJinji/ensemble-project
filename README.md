## 1. Airbnb price prediction
### 1.1 Motivation
Predicting Airbnb prices in New York City can be a fascinating project because it offers an excellent opportunity to study and understand the factors that impact Airbnb prices in one of the most vibrant and diverse cities in the world. The project is relevant to real-world applications, and the insights obtained can have a practical impact in the hospitality industry. For example, the hosts and guests can make more informed decisions, leading to better experiences and more effective use of resources. 

In the context of this project, we can explore the relationship between different features such as location, amenities, and host characteristics, and how they affect the price of a listing. Additionally, we can investigate how different ensemble methods like Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, etc. can improve the accuracy and robustness of the predictions.
